# Dr. Murray's Notes on Writing Ethically & Effectively

## Examples of Unethical Communication

An integral part of maintaining ethical communication pertains to recognizing
the ways ways in which "colleagues or supervisors on the job might violate or
disregard standards of practice" (Tabeaux and Dragga p. 36)

Here are examples of unethical writing (Don't do these)

1. Plagiarism and theft of intellectual property
2. Deliberately imprecise or ambiguous language
3. Manipulation of numerical information
4. Use of misleading illustrations
5. Promotion of prejudice
6. Failing to make information accessible
7. Uncritical use of information

## Ethics Decision Checklist

Here are some good questions to ask yourself

- What is the nature of the ethical dilemma?
- What are the sepecific aspects of this dilemma that make you uncomfortable?
- What are your competing obligations in this dilemma?
- What advice does a trusted supervisor/mentor offer?
- Does your company's code of conduct address this issue
- Does your professional association's code of conduct address this issue?
- What are you unwilling to do? What are you willing to do?
- How will you explain or justify your deicion(s)?

## Good Writing = Ethical Writing

> "If you want your report to be read, use a style that your readers can follow
> easily. If your readers can't understand your report as they read it and must
> constantly reread sentences and paragraphs, they may just disregard it or toss
> it out. Unreadable documents usually result from ineffective style" (Tabeaux
> and Dragga p. 50).

## Effective Paragraphs

1. Begin each paragraph with a topic sentence that summarizes the ideas to come
2. Include only information relevant to the topic sentence
3. Place sentences in logical order
4. Avoid long paragraphs (don't exceed 5-7 sentences, or one page)

## Effective writing style

1. Determining the reader's knowledge of the subject
2. Determining whether a particular style will be expected
3. Adjusting the style to the readers, purpose, and context

## Effective sentences

1. Watch sentence length
2. Keep subjects and verbs close together
3. Avoid pompous language ("write to express, not to impress")
4. Avoid excessive use of is/are verbs, use other verbs for variety
5. Use active voice for clarity (as opposed to passive voice)
   1. Caveat: Some disciplines use passive voice in the academy

## Style Checklist

- Planning
  - How will you adjust your writing style to acommodate your readers' knowledge
    of the subject?
  - How will you meet your readers' expectations about style for the specific
    kind of document you are writing?
  - Can you determine the appropriate reading level for the context in which the
    document will be read?
  - How will you adjust your style so that it is appropriate for the
    professional relationship you have with your readers?
- Revision
  - Do paragraphs begin with a topic sentence? Do the subsequent sentences in
    the paragraph build on the idea in the topic sentence?
  - Are most sentences twenty words or shorter? Could you make any longer
    sentences shorter?
  - Are subjects and verbs close together in your sentences?
  - Have you used specific nouns and concrete verbs?
  - Have you avoided ponderous and impersonal language?
  - Have you avoided is/are verbs when possible?
  - Are most of your sentences written in active voice? Could you change any
    sentence with passive voice to active voice?
  - Have you defined everything that might require defining?
  - Could you write any of your sentences with equal clarity but fewer words?
