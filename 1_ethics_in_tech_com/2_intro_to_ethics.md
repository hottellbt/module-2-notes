# Introduction to Ethics

Ethis is extremely important in technical communication.

Good writing is not just a matter of grammar or functionality. There is also the potential to cause harm.

Also, legality and morality may overlap, but they do not define each other.

## Four basic kinds of moral standards

According to ethicist Manuel G. Velasquez, there are four basic kinds of moral standards:

1. Utility - Benefits from taking an action
2. Rights - Individual entitlements to autonomy and well-being
3. Justice - Distribution of benefits and burdens among people
4. Care - Compassion, concern, love, friendship, kindness

These standards can contradict each other, and the real world is often quite
messy. Though, after some analysis, you can likely come to a reasonable
decision.

Kant's maxim is to do whatever you would want everyone else to do in this
situation. If you don't want everyone stealing, then you should not steal. If
you want people to return lost items, then return lost items.
