# Characteristics of Technical Writing for Computer Science

## Constructing Sentences

Sentences are the building blocks of writing.

- Write in complete sentences, avoid sentence fragments and run-on sentences.
  - Sentences should generally be between 15 and 20 words
- Maintain subject-verb agreement
  - If the noun is plural or singular, then the verb should match
- Use parallel structures

## Writing Paragraphs

- Two types: body paragraphs & transitional paragraphs
  - Body paragraphs create the overall structure
  - Transitional paragraphs help readers follow your argument
- All paragraphs contain a topic sentence and supporting details
  - The paragraph should remain focused on this topic
- Effective paragraphs center around one key idea

## Transitions & Signposting

Using transitions and signposting helps readers understand where you are going
and follow your line of thought.

- Transitions demonstrate the relationship between ideas
- To show additions, use _likewise_, _similarly_, or _moreover_
- To show contrast, use _although_, _however_, _in contrast_, or _on the other
  hand_
- To show cause and effect, use _as a result_, _consequently_, or _therefore_
- To show summary or conclusion, use _at last_, _finally_, _in conclusion_, or
  _in summary_
- Signposting helps readers understand where your argument is going

## Tone, professionalism, and formality

- Revisit your understanding of audience, purpose, and topic to assess the tone
- Formality is audience-dependent
- Subject also influences formality
  - Some topics warrant being serious even if everyone involved is your friend
- When in doubt, be formal and professional

## Word Choice

The goal is to be clear, specific, and concise. Write to express, not to impress

- Word choice can enhance or detract from your writing
- Avoid unnecessary jargon and "fancy" (pompous) words
- Beware of wordy phrases

## Consider Cultural Background

- Many of your readers may not be native English speakers
- Use short, clear sentences and active voice
- Consider including a glossary of key terms (e.g. in an Appendix)
