# Search Engine Breakdown

> Two leading researchers investigate racial bias built into widely used search
> engines.

Google handles over 90% of all information searches online globally.

In the past, content was not ranked, and instead ordered by subject (like a
library using the Dewey Decimal System). Google ranks content, and isn't
entirely clear on what causes content to be ranked above other content.

Ranks imply that one result is objectively better than the other, and doesn't
acknowledge that everything is created in a specific cultural context.

Google is effective when searching for specific, objective questions, such as
the locations of restaurants. Though, when more complex questions without a
single, objective answer arise, it falls flat.

White-associated names more often result in neutral ads on Google.
Black-associated names resulted in ads suggesting an arrest record more than 80%
of the time (regardless if anyone with that name has been arrested before). This
places an unfair disadvantage for people who have black-associated names.

Bias can enter the system through common members of society society clicking on
links and giving those links more weight.

When you type in a query to Google, you don't necessarily get a counterpoint or
something to reframe what you're thinking.
