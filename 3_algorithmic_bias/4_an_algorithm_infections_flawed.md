Epic Systems created a system to predict cases of sepsis based on a patient's
test results. It looked for signs of sepsis using a proprietary formula. It
turns out that it is deeply flawed. It missed 2/3 of each sepsis case, most
cases that it did find were also found by human staff, and it frequently issued
false alarms.

Other systems have been used in other areas, but also performed poorly or did
not perform as well for nonwhite patients.

Vendors don't disclose how these systems work behind the scenes, and there are
not any independent validations of the vendors' claims.

An excess of false alarms and bad alerts can cause "alert fatigue", which is
when you feel overwhelmed and stop caring about each individual popup regardless
of its importance.
