# Alondra Nelson Wants to Make Science and Tech More Just

> The deputy director of the White House science office plans to tackle
> algorithmic bias and start candid conversations about the past

I decided to pick out some excerpts that I feel drive the point home well
enough. The bold text is something I added.

> In her first formal remarks in her new role in January, **Nelson called
> science a social phenomenon** and said technology such as artificial
> intelligence can reveal or reflect dangerous social architectures that
> undergird the pursuit of scientific progress. In an interview with WIRED,
> **Nelson said the Black community in particular is overexposed to the harms of
> science and technology and is underserved by the benefits.**

> "I think it takes a real commitment to want to move from technical standards
> to what I call sociotechnical standards. **A tool can be technically exactly
> right**—we can think about the work that Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru did
> around bias and facial recognition [which showed that many facial recognition
> programs are better at identifying white and male faces than female faces with
> dark skin]. **But that doesn’t deal with the socio-technical issue, which is
> that there's still potential for disproportionate harm based on the
> incompleteness of the database** and what we think the data tells us and what
> we think it "predicts" in the world."

> "Science, like democracy, is a process, and it's never quite realized but
> always trying to perfect itself."
