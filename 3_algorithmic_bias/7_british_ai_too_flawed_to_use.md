# A British AI Tool to Predict Violent Crime Is Too Flawed to Use

> A government funded system known as Most Serious Violence was built to predict
> first offenses but turned out to be wildly inaccurate

Most Serious Violence (MSV) was made to predict if someone would commit their
first violent offense with a gun or a knife in the next two years. It scored
people, with higher scores implying a higher likelihood to commit violent crime.

A coding "flaw" was discovered that made MSV unviable. Before that flaw was
discovered, MSV was thought to be extremely accurate. Now, even in the ideal
conditions with the base case scenario, MSV is only 51% accurate at its absolute
best.

MSV won't be used any time soon.
