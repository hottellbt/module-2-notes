# Lawmakers Demand Scrutiny of Racial Bias in Health Algorithms

> Four Congress members say formulas that include race as a factor can hurt
> Black Americans' access to care

system for compensation for brain injuries was racially biased due to an
algorithm that assumes white people have "intrinsically higher cognitive
function than Black people"

Now Four Democratic lawmakers warn that including race in healthcare-related
calculations can cause doctors to make biased decisions against people of color.
